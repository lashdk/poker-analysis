I was always fascinated by the game of texas hold'em poker so I wrote a small program to analyse the game of poker. 
The result of the analysis are published in the article I wrote for my college statistics blog.  "Statiquo"
The code for the analysis is in "poker.py" and a copy of the blog is in the "The Best Hand"
